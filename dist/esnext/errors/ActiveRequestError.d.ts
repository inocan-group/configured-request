 * what Axios's `AxiosError` provides but provides a slightly different surface area (the underlying
 * error _may_ or _may not_ be an Axios derived error).
 *
 * Note that the underlying error can be found in it's full form at `[err].baseError` and you can
 * test whether this underlying error as from Axios with `[err].isAxiosError`.
 *
 * Finally, in situations where one catch block throws an `ActiveRequestError` within another catch
 * block (presumably with a different "location" property) this error will return the original error.
